## This is an app to get familiar with Angular 12 features such as

-   RxJS
-   (lazy loading of) Angular Modules
-   services
-   HttpClient
-   Resolvers
-   Route guards
-   ...

Data is retrieved from [JsonPLaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a free fake API for testing and prototyping

[Bulma](https://bulma.io) CSS added for styling, [Cypress](https://cypress.io) for basic e2e testing

It started out a bit unstructured to experiment with these topics and gradually I felt the need to structure code so things have changed over time. Development was definitely not well structured.

_Angular CLI yadidada:_

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
